Why do we need one more framework for Node.js?
====

Raw `Node.js` application is *very* low-level. You need to handle all the requests by your own. It is pain in the ass..

Another pain in the same place is when you try to use very big framework with tons of agreements and conventions. Most of today's frameworks (full-stack or rails like) - are big and mostly like a black boxes. You never know how they work inside! And if you know - then you're probably simply one of it's developers :-)
For all other developers it is still black box. Most of them can feel inconfortable feeling because of it. You doing something, you see that it works, but you don't feel control over your application that handles by this big closed monster!

Don't panic.
There is one of the most usable and downloadable frameworks with great tested architecture and nice middleware-conventions: `Express.js`
